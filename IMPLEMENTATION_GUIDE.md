- Use feature flags for all major changes
- Maintain parallel implementations during transition
- Comprehensive integration testing
- Gradual rollout with monitoring

#### Risk: Performance Degradation
**Mitigation**:
- Benchmark before and after each phase
- Set up performance regression tests
- Monitor key metrics continuously
- Have rollback procedures ready

#### Risk: Data Loss
**Mitigation**:

- Test recovery procedures regularly
- Use transactions where applicable
- Maintain audit logs

### Operational Risks

#### Risk: Deployment Failures

- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Automated rollback triggers
- Comprehensive smoke tests
- Canary deployments

#### Risk: Monitoring Blind Spots
**Mitigation**:
- Deploy monitoring before changes
- Use synthetic monitoring
- Regular monitoring audits
- Alert on "no data" conditions

### Team Risks

#### Risk: Knowledge Silos
**Mitigation**:
- Pair programming for complex changes
- Comprehensive documentation
- Regular knowledge sharing sessions
- Rotation of responsibilities
